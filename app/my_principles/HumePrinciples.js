          Exploring Nietzsche's Philosophy: Five Fundamental Concepts

            <h2 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">The Will to Power</h2>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
              Nietzsche's concept of the 'will to power' describes a fundamental force that drives
              all human behavior and ambition. He suggests that the driving force of humanity is not
              survival or pleasure, but a more profound and encompassing drive to assert and enhance
              one's own power and influence.

            <h2 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Eternal Recurrence</h2>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
              The idea of eternal recurrence posits that all events in life will perpetually repeat
              themselves in the same sequence. Nietzsche used this concept as a way of questioning
              the value of life and existence, proposing it as a measure for evaluating the worth of
              one's current life choices.

            <h2 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Master-Slave Morality</h2>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
              Nietzsche distinguishes between two types of morality: master morality, which arises
              from the nobility and is characterized by values like strength and pride, and slave
              morality, which emerges from the oppressed and is characterized by values like
              kindness and sympathy.

            <h2 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Übermensch (Overman)</h2>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
              The Übermensch, or Overman, is a concept representing an individual who has
              transcended the limitations of ordinary human morality to create their own values and
              purpose. This ideal person embodies the full realization of the will to power and
              lives a life beyond conventional moral codes.

            <h2 className="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Perspectivism</h2>
            <p className="text-sm md:text-base">
              Perspectivism is Nietzsche's view that all knowledge and truth are contingent and
              conditional, interpreted from specific perspectives. This philosophy rejects the idea
              of objective truth, suggesting that what we understand as truth is merely an
              interpretation shaped by various cultural, historical, and individual factors ...
